## About spectral libraries and spectral archives
### What is a spectral library?
Analytical chemists have long used the fragmentation pattern of an unknown
analyte in the mass spectrometer to infer structural information, but this
process was manual and time-consuming. It would also be repetitive, as the same
analytes would be detected over and over again in different experiments in
different laboratories. Therefore, to take advantage of previous identifications
and automate the interpretation, it was sensible to collect such identified
spectra in a “library” and use them as references for data analysis in future
experiments.

The task of assigning a query spectrum to a molecular structure is simplified to
finding the corresponding spectrum generated by the same molecule, if it exists,
in the reference spectral library.

Since 2006, NIST has begun to extend their library building operation to include
peptides, and data repositories such as the [Global Proteome
Machine](http://gpmdb.thegpm.org), [PeptideAtlas](http://www.peptideatlas.org)
and [PRIDE Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) started to compile and
release spectral libraries from the rapidly accumulating data the community
collected.

### What is a spectral archive?
Spectral Archives are clusters of similar spectra, both identified and
unidentified, across multiple datasets. Like spectral libraries, spectral
archives can be used to perform accurate spectrum similarity–based
identifications. Archives also extend libraries, making it possible to analyze
peptides that would typically remain below the radar with traditional database
searches, opening new opportunities in areas such as proteogenomics or biomarker
discovery.

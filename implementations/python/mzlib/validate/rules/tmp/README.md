Excel sheet of metadata terms as discussed during mzSpecLib development. This sheet is temporary
and will be replaced a JSON file that can be used for mzSpecLib validation and automatic generation
of documentation in markdown.

Run the script `excel_terms_to_json_rules.py` to generate the JSON file. Then a Python script will
be run in GitHub Actions to convert this JSON file to markdown documentation.

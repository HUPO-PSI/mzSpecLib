# Isobaric Label Peak Names

In mzSpecLib library peak annotations, reporter ions and other peaks related to reporter ions will be labeled with
the following conventions. A useful resource for currently available reporter ions is available at the UWPR:
https://proteomicsresource.washington.edu/protocols03/isotopic_labeling.php. Additional information about TMT is
available in the Thermo Fisher TMT brochure:

# iTRAQ peaks

- iTRAQ113
- iTRAQ114
- iTRAQ115
- iTRAQ116
- iTRAQ117
- iTRAQ118
- iTRAQ119
- iTRAQ121
- iTRAQ4Nterm
- iTRAQ8Nterm

The "Nterm" elements refer to the entire N terminal label, including both the reporter and balance group. These commonly fall
off together producing a peak at the full label mass plus a proton.

Each of these may also be used as a neutral (or charged actually) loss. It is also common to to see
- p-TMT6Nterm

It is also not unusual to see a series of peaks such as:
- p-iTRAQ114
- p-iTRAQ115
- p-iTRAQ116-H2O
- etc.

wherein the reporter ion falls off with a charge (yielding the reporter ion peak) and the full peptide sequence plus the
balance group is seen as a singly charged ion.

# Neutral loss group names

In mzSpecLib library peak annotations, complex neutral loss groups that are not conveniently described
by chemical formulae can be denoted using the following tags enclosed in square brackets, e.g. y6-[Hex]
for a hexose loss from the y6 primary ion.

If the chemical formula is long enough that it can conceivably map to many possible functional groups,
then we use this complex group mechanism to be more specific. For example, there is no point of making a
`[Water]` tag because H2O is already clear and unambiguous.
